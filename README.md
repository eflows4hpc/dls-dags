# DLS DAGs

This repository contains all DAGs that are (or can be) used in the [DLS](https://github.com/eflows4hpc/data-logistics-service).

To develop your own DAG, please see the airflow documentation and/ or look at the example DAGs in this repository.

The DLS deployments for the eflwos4HPC project pull updates from this repository in regular intervals (WIP at the moment), which means newly created or modified DAGs are deployment automatically (although with some delay).
